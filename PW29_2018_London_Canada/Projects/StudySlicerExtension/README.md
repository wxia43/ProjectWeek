# Project Description
<!--Learn how to use matlab-slicer bridge and learn how to use plus library in slicer. --> 
Learn how to use matlab-slicer bridge and learn how to use plus library in slicer to implement laser line segmentation and surface reconstruction in endoscopes.


## Objective
1. Objective A. Learn how to use matlab-slicer interface. 
1. Objective B. Learn how to use plus library for laser line surface reconstruction using endoscopes. 


## Approach and Plan

1. Just learn how to use matlab-slicer interface.
1. See how far we can go to implement part of laser line segmentation algorithm in plus.
1. ...
